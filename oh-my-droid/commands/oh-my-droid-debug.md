description: Systematic debugging and root cause analysis with the oracle droid
argument-hint: <error message, bug description, or question>
---

Delegate this to the **oracle** droid via the Task tool.

Problem: $ARGUMENTS

The oracle must:
1. **Reproduce**: Understand symptoms -- what's failing, what's the error?
2. **Isolate**: Narrow down location -- grep error messages, trace data flow
3. **Diagnose**: Identify root cause with evidence from code (file:line references)
4. **Explain**: Clear explanation of what went wrong and why
5. **Recommend**: Specific fix suggestion with code references
6. **Prevent**: How to prevent this class of bug in the future

Output: Symptoms, Root Cause (with evidence), Debugging Steps, Recommended Fix, Prevention.
