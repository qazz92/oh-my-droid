Delegate this to the **metis** droid via the Task tool.

Task: Analyze $ARGUMENTS

Metis must:
1. Parse all explicit and implicit requirements
2. Survey relevant codebase areas to understand current state
3. Identify technical constraints, framework limitations, existing patterns
4. Map dependencies -- what needs to change and what it affects
5. Assess complexity (Low/Medium/High) and flag potential blockers
6. List ambiguities that need user clarification before planning

Output format: Requirements, Current State, Constraints, Dependencies, Feasibility Assessment, Ambiguities.
