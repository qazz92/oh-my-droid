description: Create a strategic implementation plan with phases, risks, and effort estimates
argument-hint: <project or feature to plan>
---

Delegate this to the **prometheus** droid via the Task tool.

Plan for: $ARGUMENTS

Prometheus must:
1. **Understand**: Read requirements and explore relevant codebase areas
2. **Assess**: Identify constraints, dependencies, risks, and edge cases
3. **Design**: Create technical approach with clear rationale
4. **Plan**: Break into phases with ordered tasks, effort estimates, and dependencies
5. **Risk**: List risks with severity (High/Medium/Low) and mitigation strategies

Every task must be specific enough for an executor droid to implement without ambiguity.

Output format: Requirements, Technical Approach, Phases (with tasks and estimates), Risks, Acceptance Criteria.
