description: Research documentation, APIs, patterns, and solutions with the librarian droid
argument-hint: <topic, API, or question>
---

Delegate this to the **librarian** droid via the Task tool.

Research topic: $ARGUMENTS

The librarian must:
1. **Internal search**: Check project docs, README, existing code patterns via Grep/Read
2. **External search**: Use WebSearch/FetchUrl for official docs, API references, examples
3. **Synthesize**: Combine findings into clear, actionable guidance
4. **Cite**: Include URLs or file paths as sources for every claim
5. **Distinguish**: Separate official documentation from community examples and personal analysis

If information is uncertain or potentially outdated, flag it explicitly.

Output: Summary, Findings (from project + external), Recommendation, Sources.
